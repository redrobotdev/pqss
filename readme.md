# PQSS | Programmable Query Survey System

This is an open-source typescript system comprised of smaller libraries enabling you to create complex survey systems using code.
The goal is to have a fully compliant Typescript API, that you can create general surveys such for creating tests for students, university research, ux/ui surveys and so much more.

> The library is in the very early phases so do not use in production.

## Current Feature list:

1. Using API calls, create an run a survey
2. add conditional logic
3. typescript autocomplete checking

## Work In progress:

1. React based UI to collect responses
2. Refactor code, separate out responses to a different collection
3. Vue based UI to collect responses
4. Angular based UI to collect responses
5. svelte based UI to collect response
